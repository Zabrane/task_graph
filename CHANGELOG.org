Task graph now uses completely different, faster locking mechanism in
the BEAM VM.

Memory consumption has been reduced.

Added new =keep_going= flag that commands task graph to run all tasks
even in presence of failures.

** task_graph:abort
It is now possible to abort graph execution gracefully using the new
=task_graph:abort()= API.

** guards now don't require resources
Now the guard runs before the task acquires resources.
